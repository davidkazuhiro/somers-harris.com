they were all the same. \u00a0From the Queen to the pageboy, all had the same access to Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Harry and Meghan are married and carry the title of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the same county where I was a choirboy \u00a0in the parish church of St. Peter&#8217;s in Brighton.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.somers-harris.com\/cdaa8b8e-eb53-4bfe-b50d-1292a0e3014b\/\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3684\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/www.somers-harris.com\/2018\/05\/20\/harry-mehgan\/cdaa8b8e-eb53-4bfe-b50d-1292a0e3014b\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.somers-harris.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B.jpeg?fit=2048%2C1536\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.somers-harris.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B.jpeg?fit=300%2C225\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.somers-harris.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B.jpeg?fit=840%2C630\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3684\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.somers-harris.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B.jpeg?resize=840%2C630\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.somers-harris.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.somers-harris.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B.jpeg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.somers-harris.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B.jpeg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.somers-harris.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900 1200w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.somers-harris.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/www.somers-harris.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/CDAA8B8E-EB53-4BFE-B50D-1292A0E3014B.jpeg?w=1680 1680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I am so grateful for the technology that enabled me to watch this historic event and feel one with so many others who pray to \u201cOur Father\u201d.
